# ITML-Noisy-Label
It is a repository which is used to save the code of experiment related with ITML and surgical fine-tuning  
In our experiment, CIFAR-10/100, CIFAR-10/100N and ANIMAL-10N datasets are needed
---
**train_all.py:** train all the needed model and save the log file and weight file  
**train_animal_data.py:** train ANIMAL-10N dataset  
**train_CIFAR_data.py:** train CIFAR-10/100N dataset  
**curve_plot.ipynb:** plot the curve to compare the results  
**fine_tuning.ipynb:** Introduce the surgical fine tuning algorithm which outperform re-train on all clean data  
**load_dataset.ipynb:** load and analysis the needed dataset
